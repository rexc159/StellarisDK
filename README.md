# Stellaris Modding Kit
General Purpose Mod Development Tool Kit for Stellaris

## High Level Goal
This modding kit, or "Stellaris Development Kit (SDK)" is designed to:
* Reduce the time necessary for Modders to create/update mod data
* Reduce learning curve for new Modders
* Reduce the chance of error while editing events

#### Effort Estimation
The SDK is expected to cost around 120-160 person-hours to complete.
However, as this is currently a single person project, estimation is subject to change.

## Current Features
* Mod Descriptor Editor

## Current Tasks
* Data parser - `5%`
* Main U.I. - `40%`
* Event U.I. Editor - `0%`

## Future Plans
